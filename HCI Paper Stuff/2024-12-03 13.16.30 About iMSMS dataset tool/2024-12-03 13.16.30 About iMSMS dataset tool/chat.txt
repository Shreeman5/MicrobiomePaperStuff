13:51:35	 From Laurie Lyon : My email to Cathy last week:

Even though this is a bit further down the road, I have a connection to Dr. Lisbeth Finseth through Project Bridge (she was a former CO branch president at CU-AMC). She's the senior manager for advocacy at the National MS Society. I think she could be a great contact to talk about engagement with the MS community. She works with scientists, clinicians, donors, and patients with MS in her job.
